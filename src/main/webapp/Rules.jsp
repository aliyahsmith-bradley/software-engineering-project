<h1>How to Play Five Draw</h1>
<p>
    <strong>What is Five Card Draw?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Five-card draw poker is a form of poker that you can play with a single 52-card deck and between two and five players.
    The goal of the game is to create the highest ranking poker hand made up of five-cards.
    <br>
    <br>
    In five-card draw, the dealer gives each player a starting hand of five-cards. The players have to decide how many
    of their cards they want to keep and the number of cards they want to replace to try to improve their hand. Some
    house rules dictate how many cards you can replace from your starting hand.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are no community cards in this poker variant and no one will see your hand until showdown (after the final
    round of betting).
    <br>
    <br>
    Each game of five-card draw is relatively quick compared to other poker games because there are so few betting
    rounds and drawing rounds.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What are the rules of 5-card draw?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Just like in other poker games, there are betting rounds where each player must decide whether to fold, check, or
    raise. In five-card draw, house rules usually dictate limits, but it’s possible to play fixed limit, pot limit, and
    no limit games.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you’re playing with fixed limits, you can only bet or raise based on predetermined fixed bets. These bets are
    called the small bet and the big bet. In pot limit, you can raise as much as you want as long as your raise is
    below the overall value of the pot. In no limit games, you can bet or raise as much as you want, from the amount
    of the previous bet to going all-in.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Blinds and Antes</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you’re playing at home, you can define the betting structure according to your preference, but usually, you’ll
    play with blinds or with antes.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you’re playing with blinds, the player to the left of the dealer posts the predetermined small blind, and the
    player to their left plays the big blind before the starting hand is dealt. Each of the remaining players has to
    match the big blind after viewing their cards if they want to play.
    <br>
    <br>
    When playing with antes, each player contributes the same amount to the pot before any cards are dealt.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How to play 5-card draw</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Five-card draw is a fast game to play but it’s important to pay close attention to each betting round and dealing
    round to improve your odds of winning.
    <br>
    <br>
    Like all other poker variants, bluffing is an important part of the game. Winning isn’t just about having the best
    hand; it’s about staying in the game longer than your opponents. The more players exit the game before showdown,
    the higher your chance of winning.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Blinds and antes</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Before the cards are dealt, blinds and antes go into the pot. If you’re playing with blinds, only the two players to
    the dealer’s left make forced bets. If you’re playing with antes, every player must contribute the predetermined
    forced bet to be included in the deal.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Starting Hand</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    The dealer gives each player a starting hand of five-cards. Players can look at their hands.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>First betting round</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Each player has to evaluate their starting hand and decide if they want to check, call, raise, or fold. If no one
    has placed a bet, you can check, or choose to bet nothing and stay in the game. If anyone has placed a bet, the
    remaining players can only call, raise, or fold.
    <br>
    <br>
    When you call, this means you’re matching the bet before you. To raise means to increase the size of the bet. To
    fold means to bow out of the game and bet nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Drawing round</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you’re happy with your starting hand and you don’t want to swap out any of your cards, you can choose to stand
    pat. Otherwise, each player places the cards they want to replace face down on the table and tells the dealer how
    many cards they need.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you’re playing at home, you should decide ahead of time the maximum number of cards each player can replace in
    the drawing round.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Second Round of Betting</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Each player looks at their new cards and bets based on the strength of their hand. Again, each player must check,
    call, raise, or fold.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Showdown</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    As long as more than one player remains in the game, all remaining players must turn over their cards and reveal
    their hand. The highest ranking hand wins the full pot.
