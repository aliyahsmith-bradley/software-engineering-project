## Overview

Welcome to our Software Engineering Project, Five Card Draw Game UI/Web App! In this project, we aim to create an intuitive and enjoyable user interface for the classic card game, Five Card Draw. Whether you're an experienced poker player or a novice looking to learn, our application will provide you with an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Phases of the Project

### User Stories

In this initial phase, we will define the key user stories and requirements for our project. This includes understanding the needs and expectations of our target audience, as well as identifying the essential features and functionalities that our application must provide. We will prioritize these user stories to ensure a smooth development process.
